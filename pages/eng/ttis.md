# Transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation (tTIS)

* The tTIS consists of two high-frequency electrical fields that will flow through the brain and will stimulate its activity. 
* High frequency transcranial electrical stimulation (250Hz) has been employed in previous studies and has been proven to be a safe way to investigate brain functions in healthy adults. 
* The stimulation protocol we will implement will last approximately 20 minutes and it is supposed to be painless.  

* We are using two DC Stimulator Plus machines (model-no: 0021,
serial-no: 0337), which is produced by the NeuroConn company. This machine has been
approved by EU for the use of tDCS and tACS on healthy adults and patients.
